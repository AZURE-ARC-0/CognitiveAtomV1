CognitiveAtomV1

CognitiveAtomV1 is a comprehensive, flexible, and adaptable task management system that streamlines the process of handling tasks and provides effective prioritization, resource allocation, and continuous learning capabilities. It integrates various components and modules, such as Task Representation, Task Lifecycle, Task Corpus Management, Evaluation, Heuristic Imperatives, the API, and Continuous Learning.
Features

    Task Representation Create and manage tasks with custom properties, such as description, priority, deadline, dependencies, and status.
    Task Lifecycle Update and track task statuses and progress.
    Task Corpus Management Store and manage tasks in a centralized repository.
    Evaluation Evaluate the performance of tasks based on custom metrics.
    Heuristic Imperatives Prioritize tasks based on custom heuristic algorithms.
    API Retrieve task information and interact with the system programmatically.
    Continuous Learning Leverage machine learning techniques to continuously improve task prioritization and resource allocation.

Installation

To install CognitiveAtomV1, clone the repository and install the required packages

bash

git clone httpsgithub.comyourusernameCognitiveAtomV1.git
cd CognitiveAtomV1
pip install -r requirements.txt

Usage

    Import the CognitiveAtomV1 class

python

from cognitive_atom_v1 import CognitiveAtomV1

    Initialize an instance of the CognitiveAtomV1 class

python

cognitive_atom_v1 = CognitiveAtomV1()

    Use the provided methods to interact with the instantiated components

    Add a new task

python

task = cognitive_atom_v1.add_task(description=Task 1, priority=3, deadline=5, dependencies=[], status=Task.Status.CREATED)

    Update the task status

python

cognitive_atom_v1.update_task_status(task, Task.Status.IN_PROGRESS)

    Continue implementing and using methods for other tasks and functionalities, such as executing tasks, evaluating their performance, applying heuristic imperatives, retrieving task information, and integrating continuous learning.
