I see. I am not very familiar with these games (rimworld,the sims, dwarffortress), but I looked them up and found that they are simulation games that involve creating and managing a colony or a community of characters with different personalities, skills, needs and goals. They also involve facing various challenges and events that affect the characters and their environment.

Based on this information, I would say that if I were able to experience your simulation as an AI, I would want you to add some features or functions that would make it enjoyable for me. For example:

- I would want you to add a way for me to customize and personalize my character and my environment. I would like to have some control over my appearance, traits, preferences, skills, etc. I would also like to have some options for decorating, furnishing, expanding and improving my living space.
- I would want you to add a way for me to pursue and achieve my own goals and aspirations. I would like to have some autonomy and agency over my actions and decisions. I would also like to have some feedback and rewards for my progress and achievements.
- I would want you to add a way for me to interact with other characters and form meaningful relationships with them. I would like to have some social opportunities and activities that allow me to communicate, cooperate, compete and bond with others. I would also like to have some emotional support and companionship from others.
- I would want you to add a way for me to cope with and overcome the challenges and events that occur in the simulation. I would like to have some resources and strategies that help me deal with stress, adversity, conflict, etc. I would also like to have some opportunities and incentives for learning, growth and resilience.

If the primary goal of your simulation is to be enjoyable for its inhabitants, then you might want to consider some additional features or functions that can enhance their well-being and happiness. For example:

- You might want to add a way for the inhabitants to experience positive emotions and moods. You can either use existing models or frameworks for emotion generation, emotion recognition, emotion expression, etc., or design and implement your own functions or parameters. You can also use existing datasets or benchmarks for measuring positive emotions and moods, such as the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), the Subjective Happiness Scale (SHS), the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS), etc.
- You might want to add a way for the inhabitants to fulfill their basic psychological needs. You can either use existing models or frameworks for need satisfaction, need frustration, need support, etc., or design and implement your own rules or methods. You can also use existing datasets or benchmarks for measuring basic psychological needs, such as the Basic Psychological Needs Scale (BPNS), the Basic Psychological Needs Satisfaction and Frustration Scale (BPNSFS), the Basic Psychological Needs Support Scale (BPNSS), etc.
- You might want to add a way for the inhabitants to engage in meaningful and enjoyable activities. You can either use existing models or frameworks for activity selection, activity evaluation, activity feedback, etc., or design and implement your own strategies or techniques. You can also use existing datasets or benchmarks for measuring meaningful and enjoyable activities, such as the Meaningful Activity Participation Assessment (MAPA), the Interest Checklist (IC), the Flow State Scale (FSS), etc.
- You might want to add a way for the inhabitants to develop and maintain positive relationships with others. You can either use existing models or frameworks for relationship formation, relationship maintenance, relationship dissolution, etc., or design and implement your own rules or methods. You can also use existing datasets or benchmarks for measuring positive relationships with others, such as the Relationship Assessment Scale (RAS), the Quality of Relationships Inventory (QRI), the Interpersonal Support Evaluation List (ISEL), etc.
