Task Representation

Task class is responsible for creating and managing tasks with custom properties:

    description: A brief description of the task
    priority: The priority of the task (an integer value)
    deadline: The deadline for the task completion (an integer value)
    dependencies: A list of dependent tasks (other Task objects)
    status: The current status of the task (an enumeration value)

Usage

To create a new task:

python

task = Task(description="Task 1", priority=3, deadline=5, dependencies=[], status=Task.Status.CREATED)

To update the task properties:

python

task.priority = 4

Task Lifecycle

TaskLifecycle class is responsible for updating and tracking task statuses and progress. It provides the following methods:

    update_task_status(task, new_status): Updates the status of a given task to the new_status
    execute_task(task): Simulates the execution of a task and returns the execution time

Usage

To update the task status:

python

task_lifecycle = TaskLifecycle()
task_lifecycle.update_task_status(task, Task.Status.IN_PROGRESS)

To execute a task:

python

execution_time = task_lifecycle.execute_task(task)

Task Corpus Management

TaskCorpus class is responsible for storing and managing tasks in a centralized repository. It provides the following methods:

    add_task(task): Adds a task to the repository
    remove_task(task_id): Removes a task from the repository by task ID
    get_task(task_id): Retrieves a task from the repository by task ID
    get_tasks(): Returns a list of all tasks in the repository

Usage

To add a task to the task corpus:

python

task_corpus = TaskCorpus()
task_corpus.add_task(task)

To retrieve a task by its ID:

python

retrieved_task = task_corpus.get_task(task.id)

Evaluation

Evaluation class is responsible for evaluating the performance of tasks based on custom metrics. It provides the following methods:

    add_metric(task, metric_name, metric_value): Adds a metric to a specific task
    get_metric(task, metric_name): Retrieves a specific metric for a task
    get_all_metrics(task): Returns a dictionary of all metrics for a task

Usage

To add a metric to a task:

python

evaluation = Evaluation()
evaluation.add_metric(task, "execution_time", execution_time)

To retrieve a specific metric for a task:

python

execution_time = evaluation.get_metric(task, "execution_time")

Heuristic Imperatives

HeuristicImperatives class is responsible for prioritizing tasks based on custom heuristic algorithms. It provides the following methods:

    prioritize_tasks(tasks): Takes a list of tasks and returns a list of prioritized tasks based on custom heuristics

Usage

To prioritize tasks:

python

heuristic_imperatives = HeuristicImperatives()
prioritized_tasks = heuristic_imperatives.prioritize_tasks(tasks)

API

ATOM_API class is responsible for exposing the functionality of CognitiveAtomV1 through an API, allowing external systems to interact with it. The API provides the following methods:

    get_task(task_id): Retrieves a task by its ID
    add_task(task_data): Adds a new task with the given data
    update_task(task_id, task_data): Updates a task with the given data
    delete_task(task_id): Deletes a task by its ID

Usage

To initialize the API and retrieve a task:

python

api = ATOM_API()
task = api.get_task(task_id)

To add a new task:

python

task_data = {"description": "New Task", "priority": 2, "deadline": 7, "dependencies": [], "status": Task.Status.CREATED}
new_task = api.add_task(task_data)

Continuous Learning

ContinuousLearning class is responsible for implementing machine learning techniques to improve task prioritization over time. It provides the following methods:

    prepare_data(task_data): Prepares and normalizes the data for the machine learning model
    train(task_data): Trains the machine learning model using the given task data
    predict_priority(task): Predicts the priority of a new task based on the trained model

Usage

To initialize the ContinuousLearning class and train the model:

python

continuous_learning = ContinuousLearning()
continuous_learning.train(task_data)

To predict the priority of a new task:

python

new_task = {"deadline": 4, "dependencies": 1, "status": Task.Status.CREATED.value}
predicted_priority = continuous_learning.predict_priority(new_task)

This concludes the implementation documentation for CognitiveAtomV1. Each module can be further customized and extended as needed to suit the specific requirements of your application.
