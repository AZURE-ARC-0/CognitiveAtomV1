Based on the provided modules, here's how you can integrate them with the existing CognitiveAgentV4-0 and REMOv4-0 code. For brevity, I'll showcase integration for the Task Representation and Task Lifecycle modules. You can follow the same approach for other modules.

First, create a new class "CognitiveAtomV1" by inheriting from CognitiveAgentV4-0:

python

from cognitive_agent_v4 import CognitiveAgentV4

class CognitiveAtomV1(CognitiveAgentV4):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.task_lifecycle = TaskLifecycle()

Now, you can extend the process_input method to handle task-related inputs:

python

class CognitiveAtomV1(CognitiveAgentV4):
    # ...

    def process_input(self, input_text: str):
        # Process input for task-related actions
        if "create task" in input_text:
            # Extract relevant task attributes from the input_text
            # Create a new task and add it to the Task Lifecycle manager
            new_task = Task(...)
            self.task_lifecycle.add_task(new_task)

            response = "Task created successfully."
        elif "update task" in input_text:
            # Extract relevant task attributes from the input_text
            # Update the task using the Task Lifecycle manager
            self.task_lifecycle.modify_task(...)

            response = "Task updated successfully."
        # ... handle other task-related actions ...

        # If the input is not task-related, process it using the existing method
        else:
            response = super().process_input(input_text)

        return response

In the main.py file, update the CognitiveAgentV4 initialization with CognitiveAtomV1:

python

from cognitive_agent_v1 import CognitiveAtomV1

# ...

cognitive_agent = CognitiveAtomV1()

Now, the CognitiveAtomV1 agent can handle task-related inputs as well as the original functionality provided by CognitiveAgentV4-0.

This is a simplified example showcasing the integration of Task Representation and Task Lifecycle modules. You can extend this approach to integrate other modules from atomv0-fullsample.
