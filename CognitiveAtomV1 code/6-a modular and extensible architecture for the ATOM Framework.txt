To integrate the modular and extensible architecture you provided into the "CognitiveAtomV1", you can create separate classes for each component in separate files, and then instantiate them in the CognitiveAtomV1 class. Here's a step-by-step guide on how to do that:

    Create separate files for each module:

    task_representation.py
    task_lifecycle.py
    task_corpus_management.py
    evaluation_module.py
    heuristic_imperatives.py

    Move the classes for each component into their corresponding files:

python

# task_representation.py
class TaskRepresentation:
    ...

# task_lifecycle.py
class TaskLifecycle:
    ...

# task_corpus_management.py
class TaskCorpusManagement:
    ...

# evaluation_module.py
class EvaluationModule:
    ...

# heuristic_imperatives.py
class HeuristicImperatives:
    ...

    Import the modules into the CognitiveAtomV1 class:

python

from task_representation import TaskRepresentation
from task_lifecycle import TaskLifecycle
from task_corpus_management import TaskCorpusManagement
from evaluation_module import EvaluationModule
from heuristic_imperatives import HeuristicImperatives

    Instantiate the components within the CognitiveAtomV1 class:

python

class CognitiveAtomV1:
    def __init__(self):
        self.task_representation = TaskRepresentation()
        self.task_lifecycle = TaskLifecycle()
        self.task_corpus_management = TaskCorpusManagement()
        self.evaluation_module = EvaluationModule()
        self.heuristic_imperatives = HeuristicImperatives()

    Use these instantiated components to implement the methods and functionalities required by CognitiveAtomV1.

The resulting CognitiveAtomV1 class will use the modular and extensible architecture provided in the sample code. Each component can be developed, tested, and updated independently, making it easier to adapt the system to different requirements, integrate new features or improvements, and troubleshoot issues in individual components without affecting the entire system. Additionally, this architecture makes it simple to create plugins or extensions for the framework, enabling users to customize the CognitiveAtomV1 according to their specific needs and preferences.
