To integrate the Evaluation module into the existing CognitiveAtomV1 class, let's create an EvaluationModule instance within the CognitiveAtomV1 class, and then modify the process_input method to handle evaluation-related inputs:

First, add an EvaluationModule instance to the CognitiveAtomV1 class:

python

from evaluation_module import EvaluationModule

class CognitiveAtomV1(CognitiveAgentV4):
    def __init__(self):
        super().__init__()
        self.task_lifecycle = TaskLifecycle()
        self.task_corpus_manager = TaskCorpusManager(self.task_lifecycle)
        self.evaluation_module = EvaluationModule()

Now, extend the process_input method to handle evaluation-related inputs:

python

class CognitiveAtomV1(CognitiveAgentV4):
    # ...

    def process_input(self, input_text: str):
        # ... Handle task-related and task corpus-related actions ...

        # Process input for evaluation-related actions
        elif "average execution time" in input_text:
            task_id = input_text.split()[-1]
            average_execution_time = self.evaluation_module.get_average_metric(task_id, 'execution_time')
            response = f"Average execution time for task {task_id}: {average_execution_time} seconds"
        # ... Handle other evaluation-related actions ...

        # If the input is not task, task corpus, or evaluation-related, process it using the existing method
        else:
            response = super().process_input(input_text)

        return response

Now, the CognitiveAtomV1 agent can handle evaluation-related inputs, along with the original functionality provided by CognitiveAgentV4-0 and the previously integrated modules.

Remember that this is a simplified example. You can extend this approach to handle other evaluation-related actions or integrate additional modules from the atomv0-fullsample.
